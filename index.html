    <h1>MANSI APPRECIATION</h1>
    <h2>By an Avid Fan - arushii</h2>

    <p>
      There is this girl Mansi and she is awesome. In so many ways. We all tend
      to forget it sometimes, and more importantly (and annoyingly) so does the
      aforementioned Mansi. As I said, she's an awesome genius, but she can be
      pretty stupid too &lt3 So this is a little reminder of a very tiny part
      of her unending ever-expanding awesomeness!!

      <h2>WHY WE LOVE MANSI</h2>
      <dl>
        <dt><h3>1. She is very very tiny</h3></dt>
        <figure>
          <img src="./im7.webp" alt="tiny mansi" />
        </figure>
        <dd>
          This girl is miniscule. She can fit in my pocket. It is always very
          fun to see this rolling tiny ball of excitement, bubbliness or
          <em>especially</em> anger! The tiny little mansi.
        </dd>

        <dt><h3>2. She is very very huggabe</h3></dt>
        <figure>
          <img src="./im8.webp" alt="huggable mansi" />
        </figure>
        <dd>
          A hug from mansi is a warm embrace from the sun. Its life giving, its
          warm, its perfect, its so so tight. You never want to let go, because
          man; you never feel quite as comfortable.
        </dd>

        <dt><h3>3. She is the best to study with.</h3></dt>
        <dd>
          With the best handwriting, best highlighters, best pens that she has
          been developing for years? Yes. These are the best notes. And they
          make studying so aesthetic. So does she; with her perfectly planned
          timetables (that she definitely sticks to), her gorgeous green wall
          during zoom sessions she will always get on, and determination to
          sneak in extra centum maths questions in every class.
        </dd>

        <dt><h3>4. She has the voice of an angel.</h3></dt>
        <dd>Sing to me always darling, and I'll sing along.</dd>

        <dt><h3>5. She is very silly.</h3></dt>
        <video src="./v1.mp4" loop controls></video>
        <dd>
          Mansi is very silly. She says stupid stuff. She feels silly things.
          She does silly dancing. She, tiny tiny mansi, tries to carry me. She
          is a carrot rabbit. She is silly silly silly omg ilysm.
        </dd>

        <dt><h3>6. She creates such beautiful things</h3></dt>
        <dd>
          She's made gorgeous dresses, immaculate designs, pretty pretty drawing
          and such soulful poetry. She tears us all apart with her words and
          letters; yet we read them again and again because they are so
          beautiful. She never lets go of her creativity, it will always thrive!
        </dd>

        <dt><h3>7. She cares so determinedly</h3></dt>
        <figure>
          <img src="./im6.webp" alt="caring mansi" />
        </figure>
        <dd>
          Mansi will not let goâ€”she will hold on so tight, you'll always know
          she's there. She is a determined girl, if she chooses to be. She is so
          determined to care so much, sometimes it hurts her. But then again,
          would it be a mansi if she didn't give it her heart and soul?
        </dd>

        <dt><h3>8. She makes you think the world's a nice place to live.</h3></dt>
        <figure>
          <img src="./im9.webp" alt="caring mansi" />
        </figure>
        <dd>
          Why do you do this Mansi. Add splashes of colour to this world, add
          trust and comfort to this world, make me feel pride swelling in my
          heart for your dreams coming true, make this place livable. Something
          I look forward to waking up to every day, just so I can see your
          face?
